1. create the folder workspace (say kafka)

2. Change the GOPATH envioronment variable to the workspace folder as follows
    export GOPATH=../../../kafka

3. Create a folder called src inside that

4. Inside the src folder create another folder called whatever name (say "main")

5. Inside src/main folder create a go file for coding (sat "app.go")

6. Initialize the go.mod file using the follwing command
    go mod init app
7. Write whatever code you need 

8. Install the third party libraries from github
    example - go get github.com/Shopify/sarama

9. Inorder to install the go tools you need to use the go install command 
much better if we can give the URL with preceding @latest wording
go get does not work for me with sarama tools
go install github.com/Shopify/sarama/tools/kafka-console-producer@latest


10. change the GOROOT envioronment variable to the workspace folder
export GOROOT=/home/asitha/Desktop/kafka

11. Change the PATH variable to the bin of the workspace
export PATH=/home/asitha/Desktop/kafka/bin

12. Now you can run the command just installed into the bin folder 
kafka-console-producer -topic=test -value=value -brokers=localhost:9092

13. Check the kowl whether the message reached to the broker at 
localhost:9000
